\section{Conclusion}
zkSharding presents a robust solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges by leveraging sharding and SNARK-based proofs. By dividing the network into execution shards and synchronizing their state via the main shard, zkSharding ensures efficient, decentralized processing without fragmenting liquidity. Ethereum serves as the settlement and data availability layer, further enhancing the system's security. Through techniques like DFRI and a multi-layer consensus model, zkSharding achieves a balance between scalability, security, and decentralization, making it a promising framework for Ethereumâ€™s future.
