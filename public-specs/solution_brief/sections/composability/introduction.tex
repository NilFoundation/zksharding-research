\label{section:l1composability}

Ensuring compatibility between Ethereum and its associated Rollups/Layer 2 (L2) 
solutions is indispensable for the development of a sophisticated infrastructure, 
ecosystem, and applications. This compatibility not only facilitates the efficient 
migration of existing applications from Ethereum networks to Rollups but also 
minimizes associated efforts and costs. A crucial aspect of this compatibility is 
the ability to write on the Layer 1 (L1) from the Layer 2 network. This paper 
presents two distinct approaches at the protocol level within the \nil's 
zkSharding framework to achieve this essential functionality.
