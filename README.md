# zkSharding Research Repository

This repository hosts internal research conducted by the =nil; Foundation on the design and implementation of the **zkSharding protocol**‚Äîan architecture tailored for multi-chain systems applied to Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling.

## üìö About This Repository

This collection includes technical documents grouped by topic, each exploring different aspects of zkSharding and multi-chain L2 systems. These materials were originally created for internal purposes.

We are sharing this research publicly as a contribution to the Ethereum and zkRollup community‚Äîsupporting learning, debate, and further innovation in the field of decentralized scalability.

**Note**: This repository does **not** represent the full extent of our internal research. It is a curated subset selected for public release.
